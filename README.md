# Multi-segment-soft-actuator-design-optimization-using-sequential-lexicographic-surrogate-assisted-GA
Multi-segmented soft robotic actuators can replicate the dexterity of human and animal appendages, but their design is complicated by the nonlinear behavior of soft materials and the large parameter space involved. We address this challenge through the application of a two-stage lexicographic surrogate-assisted genetic algorithm for the optimization and modelling of soft finger architecture. Our pipeline models the finger as a biologically plausible two-pneumatic actuator, two-bone system, parameterized to mirror the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints found in human anatomy. A key innovation is the use of a Ludwick-inspired analytic surrogate [1] (trained via radial basis function regression) to predict pressure-dependent actuator bending angles across a broad design space. Prediction of tip position is done through PCC (Piecewise Constant Curvature) based analytical equations [2]. The first stage applies a strictly prioritized genetic algorithm to identify actuator geometries that achieve sub-degree joint angle matching; a secondary energy minimization is performed only among candidates satisfying this constraint. The second stage optimizes bone lengths for each pose using a tip error and bone energy lexicographic policy, exploiting forward kinematic modelling with the fixed optimal actuators. Thus, we have tried to rigorously enforce anatomical joint angles while systematically minimizing actuation energy and fingertip position error. Results across ten anatomically referenced hand poses demonstrate consistently low total joint angle error (mean: 0.355Â°) and robust tip trajectory matching (mean position error: 11 mm), comparing well with recent soft finger optimization literature. The proposed framework provides a transparent and scalable path for the computationally guided design of multi-segmented soft actuators for bioinspired and prosthetic applications.
